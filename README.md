# README

Hi! This is the repository for the lean manufacturing project started by Raul Muniz and Juan Guerrero in an effort to provide an alternative to all of those existing solutions that help in the implementation of any lean tool that helps improve processes and reduce costs.

Additional information will be posted as project keeps evolving and as new tools become avaiable. A list of those currently avaiable and the ones we will continue to work on should be down here.

Instructions as to how to run and install the application is to be added in a form of a manual.

Things you may need to consider in advance:

* Ruby version

* System dependencies

* Configuration

* Database creation

* Database initialization

* Services (job queues, cache servers, search engines, etc.)

* Deployment instructions
